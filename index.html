		<p>The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, also known as the DHR or Toy Train, is a 2 ft (610 mm) narrow-gauge railway based on zig zag and loop-line technology which runs between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling in the Indian state of West Bengal. Built between 1879 and 1881, with six zig-zags and five loops, the railway is about 88 km (55 mi) long. Its elevation varies from about 100 m (328 ft) at New Jalpaiguri to about 2,200 m (7,218 ft) at Darjeeling. Although four diesel locomotives handle most scheduled service, the daily tourist trains (from Darjeeling to Ghum—India's highest railway station—and the Red Panda, from Darjeeling to Kurseong) and steam-enthusiast specials are hauled by vintage British-built B-Class steam locomotives. The railway's headquarters are in Kurseong.</p>
		<p>On 2 December 1999, UNESCO declared the DHR a World Heritage Site.[1] Two more railway lines were later added, and the site became known as the mountain railways of India.</p>
